	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Year was 2000 and the students of Southeast Missouri State University were
brimming with an idea of bringing a piece of their child hood to their college lives. Anime Party
was born by the seven founders that decided that the Japanese art form of anime was something
that could bring people together. It was where their child hood of watching shows like Sailor
Moon or Gundam could grow into an expansive knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mission statement of Anime Party states:</p>

<table width="100%">

<td width="88%">
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The purpose of the Anime Party is to extend awareness of
cultural diversity through the appreciation of various types of foreign
media, such as film, graphic novels, books, music, games, etc. To fulfill
this purpose, club participation will privately review media for discussion
at club meetings.” </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anime Party stands as a culture club, focusing on various media forms as
animation (anime), Literature (manga and texts), and movies, as well as exploring customs
(White Day) and ideas of the Japanese culture. On the fringes of these definitions are other
media forms (video games and music) and American fan forms (art, animation, dubbing,
cosplay, etc.) which are explored, discussed, and evaluated through the organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The founders of Anime Party are listed within the Constitution; however, none of them
are any longer active members of the club. The way the constitution was originally drafted, the
founders still had complete control regardless of being on campus or even a member. In a
redrafting of the constitution during the 2009-2010 school year, the constitution was updated
to reflect the fact that founders no longer held executive power over the club. </p>
